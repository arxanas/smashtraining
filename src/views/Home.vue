              <!-- Apparently there's no way to do a warp
              transform in CSS, so we approximate it by manually setting the size
              of all the letters.

              We're careful to set `aria-label` since screenreaders may not be able
              to read the title. Firefox's accessibility tools thought this was
              rendered as "SMASHTRAINING".

              1) The text is all uppercase because of the `text-transform:
              uppercase` setting, I guess. (That's kind of strange to me: I would
              expect that CSS directive to be used strictly for styling, and that
              screenreaders would ignore it.)
              2) The space was dropped, I assume because it was in an element by
              itself.

              border to the previous element with the actual text, because the
              border will curve outward instead of inwards.

              Instead, we render a border on the element immediately below. To
              ensure that the border is the correct length, we render a copy of the
              text above, but hide it. Keep this in sync with the text above, being
              sure to use the `underline-inner` class to hide the contents. -->

            <b>Smash Training</b> is a

              >spaced repetition</a
            >
            trainer for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate techniques. How it works:

            <ol>
              <li>
                <b>Smash Training</b> gives you a set of drills to do based on
                your current weak points.
              </li>
              <li>
                You do the drills and record how well you did.
                <b>Smash Training</b> uses a spaced-repetition algorithm to
                update its model of which exercises you should work on.
              </li>
              <li>
                You rest for a day or two, then come back for more practice.
              </li>
            </ol>

              is the best way to improve your skills in any given domain. Ten minutes of deliberate practice
              beats an entire hour of mindless repetition. The
              goal is to intensely focus on practicing techniques at the
              edge of your comfort zone.  This training system only
              works if you practice deliberately.

          <v-card-text>
            <p>
              <b>Smash Training</b> can teach you technical skills like spacing
              aerial attacks, but it can't teach you strategic skills like
              deciding which moves to use in a given situation. That's because
              it's easier to automatically generate and assess technical drills.
            </p>

            Nonetheless, having strong technical skills is a prerequisite for
            being a strong player. You won't be able to execute your strategy if
            you don't hone your technical skills first.
